# LeetCode Solutions ðŸ§ 

This folder contains my personal solutions to various coding problems on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). I'm solving these problems to improve my algorithmic thinking and prepare for technical interviews.

Each file corresponds to a single problem and includes a clear, commented solution in JavaScript, TypeScript, or another language I'm currently working with.

## ðŸ—‚ Structure

- Solutions are organized by problem name or ID.
- Each file contains:
  - Solution code
  - (Optional) Explanation or comments

## ðŸš€ Goal

The purpose of this collection is to track my progress, review my solutions later, and share them with others who might find them useful. All code is written with clarity and learning in mind, rather than just getting the correct answer.

## ðŸ“Œ Note

These are my personal solutions and may not always be the most optimal. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
